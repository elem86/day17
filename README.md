🎯 Day 17 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🗂️ Automating Excel File Merging with Python

Today’s task was all about automating the merging of multiple Excel files into a single clean dataset — a task that comes up frequently in real-world data work.

✅ What I accomplished:

  - Used pandas and glob to automatically locate and load all .xlsx files in a folder
  - Merged two campaign files (bank.xlsx and bank2.xlsx) into one seamless DataFrame
  - Exported the final result as a single Excel file for further analysis

📦 Why this matters: Manual copy-pasting between Excel files is slow and error-prone. This small script saves time and ensures consistency — especially useful in recurring reporting tasks.

📁 Dataset: Bank Marketing Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rouseguy/bankbalanced)

💻 Tools: Python, pandas
